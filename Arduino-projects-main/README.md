# Arduino Projects Collection

This repository contains a series of Arduino projects that utilize various sensors and displays to create interactive and responsive applications. Each project is designed to demonstrate practical applications with real-time feedback and control. Below is an overview of each project, including descriptions of the components and their functionality.

---

# Project 1: Distance Measurement Display
- **Components**: Ultrasonic Sensor, 7-Segment Display, Arduino
- **Description**: This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to an object in front of it. The measured distance is displayed on a 7-segment display in real-time.
- **Usage**: Displays the distance to the nearest object detected within range.

---

# Project 2: Smart Distance Counter
- **Components**: Ultrasonic Sensor, Touch Sensor, 7-Segment Display, Arduino
- **Description**: A counter increments each time an object crosses a specified distance threshold detected by the ultrasonic sensor. A touch sensor is used to reset the counter.
- **Usage**: Useful for tracking repetitive motions, such as counting hand waves, that cross a specific distance.

# Project 3: Touch-Activated Range Finder
- **Components**: Ultrasonic Sensor, Touch Sensor, 7-Segment Display, Arduino
- **Description**: Measures and displays distance only when the touch sensor is activated. The distance reading is held on the display for 5 seconds before being cleared.
- **Usage**: Allows distance measurement on demand, controlled by the touch sensor.

# Project 4: Countdown Timer with Obstacle-Activated Reset
- **Components**: Touch Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, 7-Segment Display, Arduino
- **Description**: Starts a countdown timer on the 7-segment display using a touch sensor. The timer resets if the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle within a specific range. If the countdown completes without any interruptions, it displays "E" on the 7-segment display.
- **Usage**: Ideal for timed activities where the countdown can be interrupted by an obstacle.

# Project 5: Digital Stopwatch
- **Components**: LCD Display, 2 Buttons, Arduino
- **Description**: A digital stopwatch with start/stop and reset functionality controlled by two buttons. The time is displayed on an LCD screen.
- **Usage**: Provides a basic stopwatch functionality for timing events.

---

# Project 6: Motion-Activated Alarm
- **Components**: PIR Motion Sensor, Buzzer, Arduino
- **Description**: When motion is detected by the PIR sensor, the buzzer sounds an alarm, and the timestamp of each movement detection is logged in the Serial Monitor.
- **Usage**: Useful as a simple alarm system that records the time of each motion event.

---

# Project 7: Temperature Monitoring System
- **Components**: DHT11 or LM35 Temperature Sensor, Arduino
- **Description**: Monitors the temperature and displays the reading in the Serial Monitor. A warning message is sent if the temperature exceeds a specified threshold.
- **Usage**: Ideal for monitoring ambient temperature with an alert feature for high temperatures.

---

# Project 8: People Counter with Direction Detection
- **Components**: 2 IR Sensors, Ultrasonic Sensor, 7-Segment Display, Arduino
- **Description**: Counts the number of people entering or exiting through a doorway. Direction is confirmed by the ultrasonic sensor, which measures the time an object passes between the two IR sensors.
- **Usage**: Useful for tracking entry and exit in spaces where people movement needs monitoring.
